## Ethereum for developers

I have been learning about blockchain for some time even if iOS development is my main job.

I'm enthusiastic about this new technology since i know it.

There are lots of resources about Ethereum and many pros (but cons also) so if you know something about it and it's your interest getting to the point you can immediatly skip this paragraph. Everyone else I would spend some words to acclimatize you.
